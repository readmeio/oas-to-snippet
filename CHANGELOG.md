## 14.0.0 (2021-09-02)

> 🚨 BREAKING CHANGE
>
> This library no longer ships with [@readme/syntax-highlighter](https://npm.im/@readme/syntax-highlighter) and no longer exports a `getLangName` method. If you need that, you can use the `uppercase` export that the syntax highlighter library exports to do the same.
